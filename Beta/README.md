These are BETA RELEASE FILES. Changes to the design will likely occur before the design is released. 

All STLs were exported in print orientation. The slide is split into two parts if the full slide doesn't fit on your printer.
The slide is printed flat, not vertically. Use supports if needed, but it should be fine without them if your printer is tuned well.
