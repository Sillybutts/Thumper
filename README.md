## Performance

- k25 (k26 is very similar)
- - MegaXL: 80FPS avg
- - 3x Mega: WIP
- - 6x Elite: WIP
- - 6x Half Dart: WIP

## Print Info

The clip modules should be printed at 2 walls, 10% gyroid infill to be both strong (enough), and light (ish).

The sear, ram, puller, sealer, spring cup, and T pull should all be printed at 5 walls, 80%(or more) infill.

The rest of the blaster can be printed at 3 or 4 walls, 20% infill. GYROID INFILL IS BEST.

Print 4x of the "Bracket" part.

## Assembly

I am still working on an assembly video, I just need to finish editing it. For now, just follow the plunger parts of the Skewer assembly guide (http://captainslug.com/nerf/SkewerAssembly.pdf) and the grip assembly parts of the Talon Claw T4 build guide (http://captainslug.com/nerf/T4Assembly1.pdf). The harmonica clip portion is pretty easy to figure out on your own, just slide the parts together until the back is level, then put in the locking screws.

If your cam arm is wobbly on the side, print the tighter version.
