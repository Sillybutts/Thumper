## Print Info

None of this design needs supports or brims, EXCEPT for the clip modules. The clip modules do need supports. All STLs were exported in their print orientation.

This uses a little bit more than a full 1kg spool of filament. Around 60ish hours of printing at 70mm/s on my Ender3v2


The clip modules should be printed at 2 walls, 10% gyroid infill to be both strong (enough), and light (ish).

The sear, ram, puller, sealer, spring cup, and T pull should all be printed at 5 walls, 80%(or more) infill.

The rest of the blaster can be printed at 3 or 4 walls, 20% infill. GYROID INFILL IS BEST.


The whole blaster can be printed on a 150x150 print bed, as long as you place some parts diagonally.

## Assembly

I'll make a proper assembly video at some point, but for now, just follow the relevant parts of the TCU assembly guide (http://captainslug.com/nerf/TalonClawUAssembly1.pdf) and the Skewer assembly guide (http://captainslug.com/nerf/SkewerAssembly.pdf). The harmonica clip portion is pretty easy to figure out on your own.
