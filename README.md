The Thumper is a MegaXL/Shotgun, top slide prime, harmonica clip fed blaster.

### Hardware/Bill of Materials:

The Thumper uses much of the same hardware as the Charamile Designs Skewer. 
Here are the extra bits you need for the Thumper: 

- TC length (5.72 inch) plunger tube instead of the shorter Skewer PT
- Only 1 TC length threaded rod is needed
- 3x Caliburn/TC takedown pins
- Way more 4-40 screws

- 42x 4-40 screws
- 3x Caliburn/TC takedown pins
- 1x short pin (trigger pivot)
- 2x 1.75in L 10-32 screw
- 4x 10-32 nut

You also need these if you are using the optional collapsing stock.

Any shop that sells Caliburns *and* Skewers should have all this hardware available. Ask them for a custom order of these parts.
